        The process of making mochi involves pounding steamed glutinous rice
        with wooden mallets in a mortar called a "usu" or using modern machines
        designed for mochi-making. This pounding process helps create the unique
        chewiness of mochi by breaking down the rice's starches. After pounding,
        the resulting dough is shaped into various forms, such as round cakes,
        squares, or other decorative shapes.</p>
        <p>Mochi can be enjoyed in a variety of ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traditional Mochi: Plain mochi is often eaten with various toppings, such as kinako (toasted soybean flour) and sugar, or with a drizzle of sweet soy sauce.</li>
            <li>Mochi in Soups: Mochi is also commonly added to soups, such as ozoni (a traditional New Year's soup) and various hot pots, where it absorbs the flavors of the broth.</li>
            <li>Sweet Mochi Treats: Sweet variations of mochi are very popular, often filled with sweet fillings like red bean paste, ice cream, or fruit. One well-known dessert is "daifuku," which consists of a mochi shell filled with sweet filling.</li>
            <li>Mochi Desserts: Mochi is also used as an ingredient in various Japanese sweets, like "mochi ice cream," where a small ball of ice cream is enclosed in a layer of mochi.</li>
            <li>Mochi Pounding Ceremony: In Japan, mochi-making can be a part of cultural festivals and events. It's also associated with mochitsuki, a traditional ceremony involving the communal pounding of mochi.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Mochi can vary in texture and flavor depending on how it's prepared and the ingredients used. It's important to note that due to its sticky and chewy nature, mochi can be quite dense and may present a choking hazard for some individuals, so it's recommended to consume it with care.</p>
